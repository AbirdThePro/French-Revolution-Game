# AbirdThePro's French Revolution Game

This game is about the French Revolution. You can be **King Louis XVI** or **Marie Antoinette**, and face off against **Maximilien Robespierre** and his revolutionaries. You have been captured by revolutionary forces and are at the mercy of the **National Assembly**. Then, the nightmares began. Every night, your mind drifts off to a world of misery. Severed heads roll at you as you run from the spirits of the peasants. Robespierre himself will try and attack you. Luckily, you have abilities. If you play as the king, you can use the *Lock them out!* ability, which stops peasant heads for the next 10 seconds. It is based on his hobby of lockmaking and the famous occasion where he locked the National Assembly out of their meeting room, which led to the Tennis Court Oath. The queen can use the *Let them eat cake!* ability. For the next 5 seconds, all peasant heads are turned into cake that boosts your score. You are of course, a severed head in the nightmare.
This dinosaur game-like experience will bring you fun as long as you survive!
